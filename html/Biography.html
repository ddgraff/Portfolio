<!-- Bio written by the team in Madrid -->
<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
    <h4>
        In order to better get to know the members of our international team, our AVP asked us to write biographies
        about
        one another. This is what the Madrid team had to say about me.
    </h4>
</div>
<br>

<div class="col-sm-offset-1 col-sm-10">
    <p>
        Daniel was born in Kennewick, WA, in a family of seven people (mom, dad, two older sisters, himself, and two
        younger brothers). He’s married and has two kids. Amazing thing: he speaks English and…Samoan!
        He studied Biology Education at Brigham Young University – Hawaii, and yes, he did often do his homework on the
        beach (oh!!). His high school is of note too, because of their mascot. Officially they are the Richland Bombers,
        but their mascot is a mushroom cloud. Both of these are derived from WWII because the area he grew up in was
        originally used as a secret site for a reactor that created plutonium for atomic bombs. There is a running joke
        that anyone that lives in their town for too long starts to glow in the dark.
    </p>

    <p>
        During his senior research project in college he led a team that was responsible for restoring roughly 3 acres
        of Hawaiian forest after a fire destroyed it. That was a lot of work, but very fun and rewarding as well. His
        best skill is keeping people motivated. He explained to me that his worst trait is being grumpy when he gets
        stressed…but, to be honest, I don’t believe him. Anyway, he still waiting for his greatest work accomplishment:
        to get more tasks done in a day than Rocio (good luck my friend!)
    </p>

    <p>
        His family, popcorn, nature (particularly the ocean), Disneyland (Disney in general actually) and candy makes
        Daniel happy. He loves the wild life: hiking, camping, and enjoying holidays anywhere without a permanent
        structure for miles. Actually, if he were rich enough, he would like to traveling the world camping and studying
        as many ecosystems as he could. But he likes some indoor activities as well, like playing video games (Monster
        Hunter).
    </p>

    <p>
        Daniel use to like the book The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho, but lately he has also become a somewhat forced fan
        of I Love You Stinky Face by Lisa McCourt because his children want that as a bedtime story every night. He’s
        never been particularly interested in watching sports, though he did learn to love Rugby while he was in Samoa
        for two years on a church mission. His favorite game to play is actually Ultimate Frisbee. It’s sort of like
        American football, but with a Frisbee and no tackling.
    </p>

    <p>
        He definitely prefers mornings. He generally cannot keep himself awake past 11 pm, but getting up at 5 am is
        like a walk in the park for him. This is coherent with the fact he hates laziness and whining. He really can’t
        stand it when people aren’t willing to work hard so they either give up or complain rather than just getting to
        work.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a perfect wild man, he survived an extreme dramatic situation: he’s an introvert. In college, before they
        were married, his now wife tricked him into trying out for the film club’s movie. He actually got the leading
        role in a romantic comedy and, to make things more awkward for him; her twin sister got the leading female role.
        So not only did he have to make a film (which was shown for several weeks to anyone in the community that wanted
        to watch it), but he also had to “fall in love” with and even kiss his girlfriend’s twin sister. You can watch
        this masterpiece here:
